ABOUT
************
Framework for use within Boxmodel Digital.

SASS based customisable multi column responsive framework, follow instructions on
index.html for how to use. All sass files can be found within the /sass folder. Ideal workflow would be to install node using the command 'npm install'. This will install the relevent grunt tasks and set up the project correctly.
